# 17-10-25 Journal

## Repository Activity
- Added initial README in English describing the Supabase authentication React app and deployment steps.
- Created documentation structure under `docs/`, including the recorded initial prompt and setup notes.
- Ensured environment guidance covers Supabase configuration and HTTPS considerations.
- Converted all documentation (including context and journal entries) to English for consistency.
- Added an `AGENTS.md` blueprint capturing guidelines for collaborators and future AI agents.

## Conversation Highlights
- Clarified that Supabase password submissions rely on HTTPS/TLS for transport security and discussed alternative auth flows.
- Agreed not to remove the only commit in the repository to keep history intact.
- Documented the latest work so future contributors have context on requirements, implementation details, and agent practices.
